## Abstract

The planning for and development of efficient workflows for the creation, reuse, sharing, documentation, publication and preservation of research data is a general challenge that research teams of all sizes face. In response to: 

* requirements from funding agencies for full-lifecycle data management plans that will result in well documented, preserved, and shared research data products
* increasing requirements from publishers for shared data in conjunction with submitted papers
* interdisciplinary research team's needs for efficient data sharing within projects, and 
* increasing reuse of research data for replication and unanticipated research, policy development, and public use

strategies must be developed and shared that enable research teams to meet these requirements while meeting the core science objectives of their projects *within the available resources*. 

In support of achieving these goals, the concept of *Agile Data Curation* has been developed in which there have been parallel activities in support of 1) identifying a set of shared values and principles that underlie the objectives of *agile data curation*, 2) soliciting case studies from the Earth science and other research communities that illustrate aspects of what the contributors consider agile data curation methods and practices, and 3) identifying or developing design patterns that are high-level abstractions from successful data curation practice that are related to *common data curation problems* for which  *common solution strategies* may be employed. This paper provides a collection of case studies that have been contributed by the Earth science community, and an initial analysis of those case studies to map them to emerging shared data curation problems and their potential solutions. Following the initial analysis of these problems and potential solutions, *existing* design patterns from software engineering and related disciplines are identified as a starting point for the development of a catalog of data curation design patterns that may be reused in the design and execution of new data curation processes.
